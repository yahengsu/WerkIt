# WerkIt - A Fitness Tracker for Android

# About
Werk it is a Fitness Tracker application for Android. Initially developed for my grade 12 IB CS project, Werk It is my second attempt in Android development. 

# How does it work?
Users sign up through e-mail, or log in through Google+/Facebook. From there, they can create new exercises, and those exercises can be combined to create new workouts. 

# Features
- Object Oriented Design (exercises, workouts, sessions, etc.)
- User Authentication through the Firebase API
- User can set custom workouts
- Push notifications and Google Calendar integration
